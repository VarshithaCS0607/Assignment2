# Assignment2


This repository contains the code and assets for Lab 2 of the ITMD 4/541 course. In this lab, we have explored various CSS techniques to create different layouts and styles.

## Description

The lab is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of CSS layout and styling. 

overview of what each section covers:
### Flexbox Part 1

In this section, we create a horizontal navigation bar using CSS Flexbox. The navigation buttons are evenly spaced, and the goal is to match the provided example image.

### Flexbox Part 2

This section demonstrates how to use CSS Flexbox to turn an unordered list into three equal-width columns and reorder them using CSS Flexbox properties. The columns should be reordered without modifying the HTML structure.

### Flexbox Part 3
